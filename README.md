## What I Learned
This was a fun project for me as I got the opportunity to really express my creativity and showcase the work I do and what technologies I use. I certainly learned a lot about CSS styling and position and how to make the content look best across multiple platforms. This project really emphasized how important it is to understand CSS. I also got the chance to work with Pug, a HTML template engine. Tedious at first, I was able to use Pug to help me make this project cleaner an the Pug mixins really helped me cutback on writing lots of repeating code.

Overtime I also learned how important it is to make my portfolio stand out and to always improve it. After all, it really is the first impression people will get of me as a developer.
